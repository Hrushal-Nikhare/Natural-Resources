                <h3 class="title" data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="2000">What are Natural Resources?</h3>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1250">Natural resources are materials available on the planet that
                    can be used to keep
                    people alive and
                    meet their needs.

                    A natural resource might be any natural substance that humans utilize. This includes oil, coal,
                    natural gas, metals, stone, sand, air, sunlight, soil, and water. Natural resources may also include
                    animals, birds, fish, and vegetation.

                    Food, fuel, and raw materials for manufacturing are all made from natural resources. Plants and
                    animals provide all of the food that people consume. Heat, light, and power are provided by natural
                    resources such as coal, natural gas, and oil.

                    Natural resources are strongly intertwined. Therefore, removing one item would have an impact on the
                    availability or quality of the others. If water is removed from a region, the vegetation, soils,
                    animals, and even the air in that region will suffer.
                </p>

                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1550">A natural resource may exist as a separate entity such as
                    fresh water, air, as well as any living
                    organism such as a fish, or it may be transformed by extractive industries into an economically
                    useful form that must be processed to obtain the resource such as metal ores, rare-earth elements,
                    petroleum, timber and most forms of energy. Some resources are renewable resource, which means that
                    they can be used at a certain rate and natural processes will restore them, whereas many extractive
                    industries rely heavily on non-renewable resources that can only be extracted once.</p>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1700">Natural-resource allocations can be at the center of many
                    economic and political confrontations both
                    within and between countries. This is particularly true during periods of increasing scarcity and
                    shortages (depletion and overconsumption of resources). Resource extraction is also a major source
                    of human rights violations and environmental damage. The Sustainable Development Goals and other
                    international development agendas frequently focus on creating more sustainable resource extraction,
                    with some scholars and researchers focused on creating economic models, such as circular economy,
                    that rely less on resource extraction, and more on reuse, recycling and renewable resources that can
                    be sustainably managed.</p>

                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1250">There are 2 types of Natural Resources: Biotic and Abiotic
                </p>

                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1550">Biotic: Resources that originate from the biosphere and have
                    life such as flora and fauna, fisheries,
                    livestock, etc. Fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum are also included in this category because
                    they are formed from decayed organic matter.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1700">
                    Abiotic: Resources that originate from non-living and inorganic material. These include land, fresh
                    water, air, rare-earth elements, and heavy metals including ores, such as gold, iron, copper,
                    silver, etc.</p>

                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1250">
                    Potential resources: Resources that are known to exist, but have not been utilized yet. These may be
                    used in the future. For example, petroleum in sedimentary rocks that, until pulled out and put to
                    use
                    remains a potential resource.

                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1550">
                    Actual resources: Resources that have been surveyed, quantified and qualified, and are currently
                    used in
                    development. These are typically dependent on technology and level of their feasibility. E.g.: Wood

                    <p>
                        Stocks: Resources that have been surveyed, but cannot be used due to lack of technology. E.g.:

                <h3 class="title" data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="2000">Depletion of resources</h3>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1250">
                    In recent years, the depletion of natural resources has become a major focus of governments and
                    organizations such as the United Nations (UN). This is evident in the UN's Agenda 21 Section Two,
                    which outlines the necessary steps for countries to take to sustain their natural resources. The
                    depletion of natural resources is considered a sustainable development issue.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1550">
                    The term sustainable development has many interpretations, most notably the Brundtland Commission's
                    'to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
                    generations to meet their own needs'; however, in broad terms it is balancing the needs of the
                    planet's people and species now and in the future.[10] In regards to natural resources, depletion
                    is of concern for sustainable development as it has the ability to degrade current environments
                    and the potential to impact the needs of future generations.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-delay="1700">
                    Depletion of natural resources is associated with social inequity. Considering most biodiversity are
                    located in developing countries,depletion of this resource could result in losses of ecosystem
                    services for these countries. Some view this depletion as a major source of social unrest and
                    conflicts in developing nations.

                    At present, there is a particular concern for rainforest regions that hold most of the Earth's
                    biodiversity. According to Nelson, deforestation and degradation affect 8.5% of the world's
                    forests with 30% of the Earth's surface already cropped. If we consider that 80% of people rely on
                    medicines obtained from plants and 3/4 of the world's prescription medicines have ingredients taken
                    from plants, loss of the world's rainforests could result in a loss of finding more potential
                    life-saving medicines.

                    The depletion of natural resources is caused by 'direct drivers of change' such as mining,
                    petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry as well as 'indirect drivers of change' such as
                    demography (e.g. population growth), economy, society, politics, and technology. The current
                    practice of agriculture is another factor causing depletion of natural resources. For example, the
                    depletion of nutrients in the soil due to excessive use of nitrogen and desertification. The
                    depletion of natural resources is a continuing concern for society. This is seen in the cited quote
                    given by Theodore Roosevelt, a well-known conservationist and former United States president, who
                    was opposed to unregulated natural resource extraction.
